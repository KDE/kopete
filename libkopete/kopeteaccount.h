/**
 * The Kopete::Account class handles one account.
 * Each protocol implementation should subclass this class in its own custom account class.
 * There are a few pure virtual methods that must be implemented. Examples are:
 * \li \ref connect()
 * \li \ref disconnect()
 * \li \ref createContact()
 *
 * The accountId is an @em constant unique id, which represents the login.
 * The @ref myself() contact is one of the most important contacts, which represents
 * the user tied to this account. You must create this contact in the contructor of your
 * account and pass it to @ref setMyself().
 *
 * All account data is saved to @ref KConfig. This includes the accountId, the autoconnect flag and
 * the color. You can save more data using @ref configGroup()
 *
 * When you create a new account, you have to register it with the account manager by calling
 * @ref AccountManager::registerAccount.

 *
 * OnlineStatus is a class that encapsulates all information about the
 * various online states that a protocol can be in in a single class. The
 * online status consists of both a 'global' status as it's known to libkopete
 * and used for going online or away, which non-protocol plugins can use,
 * and the 'private' status, which is simply an unsigned int and is only
 * useful for the actual protocol plugin that uses the status.
 *
 * This class is passed around by value, but is refcounted to cut down on the
 * amount of overhead. All in all it should be more than fast enough for
 * general use.
 *
 * Note that ONLY the constructor can set the data, the object is considered
 * to be const after creation as there really shouldn't be a need to change
 * a status' characteristics during runtime!

 * @brief Base class for all plugins or protocols.
 *
 * To create a plugin, you need to create a .desktop file which looks like that:
 * \verbatim
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Type=Service
X-Kopete-Version=1000900
Icon=icon
ServiceTypes=Kopete/Plugin
X-KDE-Library=kopete_myplugin
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Author=Your Name
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Email=your@mail.com
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Name=kopete_myplugin
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Version=0.0.1
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Website=http://yoursite.com
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Category=Plugins
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Depends=
X-KDE-PluginInfo-License=GPL
X-KDE-PluginInfo-EnabledByDefault=false
Name=MyPlugin
Comment=Plugin that do some nice stuff
 \endverbatim
 *
 * The constructor of your plugin should looks like this:
 *
 * \code
	typedef KGenericFactory<MyPlugin> MyPluginFactory;
	static const KAboutData aboutdata("kopete_myplugin", 0, ki18n("MyPlugin") , "1.0" );
	K_EXPORT_COMPONENT_FACTORY( kopete_myplugin, MyPluginFactory( &aboutdata )  )

	MyPlugin::MyPlugin( QObject *parent, const char *name, const QStringList &  args  )
		: Kopete::Plugin( MyPluginFactory::componentData(), parent, name )
	{
		//...
	}
 \endcode
 *
 * Kopete::Plugin inherits from KXMLGUIClient.  That client is added
 * to the Kopete's mainwindow KXMLGUIFactory. So you may add actions
 * on the main window (for hinstance in the meta contact popup menu).
 * Please note that the client is added right after the plugin is created,
 * so you have to create every actions in the constructor.

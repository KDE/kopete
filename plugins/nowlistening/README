README for Now Listening Plugin

AUTHOR Will Stephenson <lists@stevello.free-online.co.uk>

This plugin tells chat partners what you're currently listening to. On demand, it sends them a configurable message.

Caveat: It currently only works with KsCD, Xmms, JuK and amaroK.  Other media players will be supported shortly.

Caveat 2: It relies on DCOP - I doubt much will happen if you're not running the rest of KDE.

Caveat 3: There's no escaping of the substituted strings, so you might get it stuck in a loop...

REQUIREMENTS
Requires XMMS remote control header xmmsctrl.h
(can be found in:
* SuSE's base xmms rpm
* Mandrake's libxmms1-devel rpm
* RedHat, TurboLinux, Conectiva: xmms-devel )
Which in turn requires glib-devel and gtk-devel to build.

IF CONFIGURE GIVES AN ERROR, OR IT DOESN'T WORK WITH XMMS, CHECK THESE ARE INSTALLED!

Configure test doesn't tell us that this is why it bails.

Rerun make -f Makefile.cvs && ./configure - or any subset of that which will
reconfigure the new part of the tree.

make

USE

Enable the plugin in Settings->Configure Plugins.  You may wish to change the default message.

You can force a notification by typing the string "/media" at the start of a new message, which will be substituted, or by using the Chat->Actions->Send Media Info menu item.

Please report to bugs.kde.org.  If you need help contact me at lists@stevello.free-online.co.uk.
